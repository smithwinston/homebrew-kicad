Homebrew Formula for the KiCad EDA Software

I try to update this daily for KICAD Builds
NOTE: This is currently in flux and may not work on your system!!!!!!
## Install

    brew tap shaneburrell/homebrew-kicad
    brew install --HEAD kicad

##
If you have bzr that is not detecting bzrtools try exporting python path. Something like the following and you may want to add ths to .bash_profile
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
